Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning 
This file contains the Machine Learning Model to predict Life Expectancy using 
Linear Regression and Extra Tree Regressor Methods. 
1: Linear Regression : In these model I have used 'SelectKBest' and 'f_regression'named as Pearson correlation parameter to select best 
10 features and then applied Linear Regression. It also contain some data preprocessing steps such as converting data like 
'Country' and 'Status' to categorical form and filling NaN by mean values. Its R2 Score is 81.5 % approx which is fair. 
2: Extra Tree Regression : In these Model also we are prdicting Life Expectancy but by using Extra Tree Regressor Method. 
In this we have done the visualization very deeply and then using correlation we have removed some features and then we have done 
some more preprocessing to convert Some data like 'Country' and 'Status' to categorical fields and filling NaN by its column mean values. 
Its R2 score is approx. 95.83 %. You may download the data file at 'https://www.kaggle.com/tejpratap1/who-life-expectancy-datasets-sample'
